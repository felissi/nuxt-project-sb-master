# Path Alias

The following path aliases are provided to provided better code structure, and share the same path resolution accross different environment, like testing, storybook, etc.

<ul>
  {Object.entries(JSON.parse(import.meta.env.SB_PATH_ALIAS)).map(([key, value]) => <li key={key}><code>{key}</code>: {value}</li>)}
</ul>

> This is evaluated at build time.

## How to add path aliases

Create path aliases in the `/config/nuxt-config.ts`, notice that the path is relative to the `.nuxt` folder, for example `/components/ui/*` should be written as `../components/ui/*`, because this will feed into `nuxt.config.ts` and `Nuxt` will handle the mege for `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` respectively.

<NamedSource
  code={`
export const config = {
  // ...
  alias: {
    "@/": "../",
    "@/*": "../*",
    "#mypath": "../mypath",
  }
}
`}
  name="/config/nuxt-config.ts"
  language="ts"
/>

## Why bother twisting üçî

The ultimate goal is to ensure all the ts compiler and bundler resolving the same path. Each sub-system in this project has its own configuration, in our case, we have the `main`, `storybook` and `test` environment, we have to make sure that they know the same path ü§î.

There is no easy way to _extend_ `TypeScript` path aliases from `tsconfig.json`, it would only overwrite all the path if we do this:

<NamedSource
  code={`
{
  "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  } // This doesn't work üò¢
}
`}
  name="/tsconfig.json"
  language="json"
/>

Also, we have to make sure `TypeScript` and `Vite` resolving the same path. Therefore we leverage `Nuxt` to takes care of the alignment and the merging job, all we need to do is to feed the `alias` in `nuxt.config.ts` üòé. (and feed the same config into `storybook` and `vitest` üòÇ).

## Why my path is not working üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

`TypeScript` and `Vite` do separate jobs, `TypeScript` resolves path just by `tsconfig.json` and intellisense can recognize it, but that doesn't necessary mean it can resolves at run time, because that is `Vite`'s job. `Vite` only refer to `resolve.alias`.

So if your intellisense is working, `tsconfig.json` is fine. Check the `alias` setting for the `Vite` config at `nuxt-config.ts`

If your intellisense is not working, check the `/.nuxt/tsconfig.json`. Make sure it is re-compiled after the change. `Nuxt` maintains `TypeScript` path by inversely inject path from `nuxt.config.ts` into `/.nuxt/tsconfig.json` at compile time.
